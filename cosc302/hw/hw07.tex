\noindent{Prof. Darren Strash}

\noindent{Colgate University} \\

\noindent{\bf Problem Set 7 --- Minimum Spanning Trees and Single Source Shortest Paths} \\
\noindent {\bf Due by 4:30pm Friday, March 30, 2018 as a single pdf via Moodle (either generated via \LaTeX{}, or concatenated photos of your work). Late assignments are not accepted.} \\

This is an \emph{individual} assignment: collaboration (such as discussing problems and brainstorming ideas for solving them) on this assignment is highly encouraged, but the work you submit must be your own. Give information only as a tutor would: ask questions so that your classmate is able to figure out the answer for themselves. It is unacceptable to share any artifacts, such as code and/or write-ups for this assignment. If you work with someone in close collaboration, you must mention your collaborator on your assignment.

\emph{Suggested practice problems, from CLRS:} 23.1-3; 23.1-6; 23.2-4; 23.2-5; 24.1-1

\begin{enumerate}
\item Problem 23.1-1 from CLRS.
\item Problem 23.2-8 from CLRS.
\item Problem 24.1-6 from CLRS. \emph{Hint: Consider running Bellman-Ford more than once.}
