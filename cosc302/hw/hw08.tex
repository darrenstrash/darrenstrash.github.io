\noindent{\bf Problem Set 8 --- Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming I} \\
\noindent {\bf Due by 4:30pm Friday, April 6, 2018 as a single pdf via Moodle (either generated via \LaTeX{}, or concatenated photos of your work). Late assignments are not accepted.} \\

This is an \emph{individual} assignment: collaboration (such as discussing problems and brainstorming ideas for solving them) on this assignment is highly encouraged, but the work you submit must be your own. Give information only as a tutor would: ask questions so that your classmate is able to figure out the answer for themselves. It is unacceptable to share any artifacts, such as code and/or write-ups for this assignment. If you work with someone in close collaboration, you must mention your collaborator on your assignment.

\emph{Suggested practice problems, from CLRS:} 15.1-4, 15.1-5; 15.3-3; 15.3-5; 16.2-1; 16.2-4; 16.2-5

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{(Worth 10 points)} Problem 16-1 from CLRS.
\item Problem 15.1-2 from CLRS.
\item Problem 15.1-3 from CLRS.
